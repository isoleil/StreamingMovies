Python code that reads a CSV with movies offered on major streaming services 

Hi everyone, this is some Python code I worked on that reads a CSV I found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney/data#). It allows you to find movies based on the director, where the movie can be streamed, how long is the movie, etc. Let me know what you guys think!
